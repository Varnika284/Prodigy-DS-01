# Prodigy Task 1: Data Distribution Visualization
This repository contains a project to create visualizations of data distributions, specifically using bar charts and histograms, for a categorical or continuous variable such as age or gender distribution in a population.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize data distribution for a chosen variable to help identify trends and patterns. By examining distributions, we can gain insights into data characteristics and detect potential outliers.

# Objectives:
Create a bar chart for categorical variables (e.g., gender distribution).
Create a histogram for continuous variables (e.g., age distribution).
Analyze the visualizations to gain insights into the data.

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required libraries: matplotlib, seaborn, pandas (installable via pip or conda)

# Usage
Load the dataset in the provided script or notebook.
Choose a categorical variable (e.g., gender) or continuous variable (e.g., age) for visualization.
Generate a bar chart or histogram using the provided code to analyze the distribution.#
